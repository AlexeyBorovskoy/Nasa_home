# NASA Home Cloud

_Old Hardware Must Live._

A family self-hosted cloud built on Jetson Nano, USB SSD, Docker Compose,
Nextcloud, Immich, Android clients, monitoring and AI-assisted reliability engineering.

## Highlights

- **Jetson Nano 4GB** as home server (ARM64, no swap — real constraints)
- **Nextcloud** for files, contacts and calendar (CardDAV/CalDAV)
- **Immich** for family photo archive (6 697 photos backed up)
- **Android clients** with DAVx5 / Nextcloud / Immich auto-backup
- **Reverse SSH tunnel** through VPS for CGNAT bypass (no port forwarding needed)
- **Monitoring** with Beszel / Uptime Kuma / Telegram daily reports
- **Reliability story** around USB SSD failures and automated recovery
- **NASA API** — custom REST API over the full stack (FastAPI, 20 endpoints, JWT)
- Open-source documentation, agent prompts and evidence
