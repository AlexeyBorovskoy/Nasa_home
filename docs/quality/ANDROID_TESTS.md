## ADB Read-Only Check (Optional)

If ADB is available for debugging:

```bash
# Safe read-only check only
tests/android/adb_readonly_check.sh
```

This script performs ONLY:
- `adb devices` -- list connected devices
- `adb shell getprop ro.build.version.release` -- Android version
- `adb shell pm list packages -3` -- installed user apps

It does NOT and MUST NOT:
- Install or uninstall apps
- Pull personal data (photos, contacts)
- Read IMEI, serial numbers, accounts
- Trigger reboots

## MIUI-Specific Notes

- MIUI Battery Saver may kill background sync. Disable battery optimization for Immich and Nextcloud.
- Path: Settings -> Apps -> Immich -> Battery -> No restrictions
- Auto-start permission may be required on MIUI for background backup.
- MIUI may block self-signed certificates in some versions. Use HTTP for local access.
