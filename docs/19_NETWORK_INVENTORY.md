# 19. Network Inventory

## 1. Purpose

This document records the home network layout for the NASA Home Cloud test stand.
It is a sanitized public inventory: real Wi-Fi passwords, router serial numbers,
router MAC addresses, and private credentials must stay in `config/.env`
(gitignored).

Updated: 2026-06-23.

Scope of this step:

1. Observe current network state.
2. Record target topology for Jetson + USB HDD.
3. Keep router, firewall, VPN, DHCP, and Wi-Fi settings unchanged.
4. Mark items that still require router UI verification.

## 2. Safety Boundaries

- Do not change router DHCP, firewall, port forwarding, VPN, Wi-Fi, or ISP
  settings during inventory.
- Do not expose Nextcloud, Immich, LLM Gateway, Samba, or SSH directly to the
  internet via port forwarding on the home router.
- Do not touch the Amnezia VPN containers on VPS 193.8.215.130 through SSH or
  `wg set` — serves ~25 clients.
- External access implemented via VPS reverse SSH tunnel (ADR-0005). Tailscale
  is archival/alternative documentation only.
- Treat router photos, SSIDs, passwords, MAC addresses, serial numbers, and
  admin credentials as secrets.

## 5. Router UI Status

The router web UI is reachable at `http://192.168.0.1` and returns the TP-Link
login page. The current screenshot shows a password-only login form. The page
uses client-side encryption before submitting login data.

Current limitation:

- `HOME_ROUTER_ADMIN_USERNAME` is recorded locally as an assumption, not as a
  router-UI-verified value.
- `HOME_ROUTER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is not known yet.
- The Wi-Fi password/PIN from the label must not be assumed to be the router
  admin password unless confirmed by the user.

Router UI verification is therefore pending. When the admin password is
available, inspect only these read-only pages:

1. LAN IP/subnet.
2. DHCP server enabled/disabled and DHCP range.
3. DHCP reservation/static lease for Jetson `192.168.0.50`.
4. Connected clients list.
5. Port forwarding / virtual servers list.
6. UPnP state.
7. Firewall remote management state.
8. Wi-Fi SSIDs/security mode.

Do not save or apply any router setting changes during this inventory.

## 6. Validation Commands

From Windows admin workstation:

```powershell
Get-NetIPConfiguration
Test-NetConnection 192.168.0.1 -Port 80
Test-NetConnection 192.168.0.1 -Port 443
Test-NetConnection 192.168.0.50 -Port 22
arp -a
```

From Windows USB recovery path to Jetson:

```powershell
Get-NetAdapter
ping -6 fe80::1%<ifIndex>
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName "fe80::1%<ifIndex>" -Port 22
ssh admin@fe80::1%<ifIndex>
```

From Jetson after LAN cable is connected:

```bash
ip -br addr show eth0
ip route
nmcli connection show nasa-lan
ping -c 3 192.168.0.1
```

Storage check after USB storage is attached to Jetson:

```bash
lsblk -o NAME,TYPE,SIZE,FSTYPE,LABEL,MOUNTPOINT,MODEL,TRAN,RO
mountpoint /mnt/storage || echo "/mnt/storage is not mounted"
sudo dmesg -T | grep -i -E "usb|uas|reset|I/O error|error -71" | tail -n 80
sudo bash scripts/storage/storage_preflight.sh
```

## 7. Current Open Items

| Item | Why it matters | Next safe action |
|---|---|---|
| Router admin password missing | DHCP range and static lease cannot be verified from UI | User provides password; inspect only |
| Jetson LAN SSH | ✅ Verified: `admin@192.168.0.50:22` works | — |
| VPS external access | ✅ Live: nginx+tunnel, ports 8080/2283/8090 | — |
| USB storage incident | 250 GB device recovered as `/dev/sda1` and mounted at `/mnt/storage`, but prior `error -71`/ext4 errors show hardware risk | Keep preflight/boot guard; replace suspect cable/enclosure/power if errors return |
| HDD partition | Target ext4 partition for NAS is active: label `nasa-storage`, UUID tracked in fstab | Keep read-only fsck path for future incidents; destructive format only with explicit confirmation |
| External access | ✅ Implemented via VPS reverse tunnel (ADR-0005) | — |

## 8. Rollback

This inventory step does not change router or Jetson network settings.

If a future router UI session accidentally opens an edit form, leave the page
without saving. If a future Jetson LAN change breaks access, use USB recovery:

```powershell
ssh admin@fe80::1%<ifIndex>
```
